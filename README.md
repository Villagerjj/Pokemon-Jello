## Letter to Nintendo

I am using GBA assets, you guys do not make these games anymore and thus, do not make a profit. You ARE NOT loosing money when someone uses these assets, this project is free, and will forever be free. I am ALSO not making money. none of the story from the originating games is being taken, so this should fall under Fair use because I am using the assets in a transformative mannor.
